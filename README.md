### :video_game: Who am I?
Someone who wants to live a thrilling, unstable life making games. I'm also trying to branch into digital illustrations and composing, but that's not what you're here for, right?

### :space_invader: Games 
You can see the games I've worked on in [my Itch page](https://chocola-mint.itch.io/), as well as a demo reel if you're in a hurry. Current recommendations are: (All can be played in your browser)
* [Touhou Tiny Trouble](https://chocola-mint.itch.io/touhou-tiny-trouble) - A short, lovely Touhou-themed platformer reminiscent of Kirby Super Star.
* [Operation: Stardust](https://chocola-mint.itch.io/operation-stardust) - An eldritch-themed strategy game reminiscent of Advance Wars.
* [Lucid Dive](https://chocola-mint.itch.io/lucid-dive) - A challenging platformer where you sling around with a grapple in a digital metropolis.
* [Sorting Battle](https://chocola-mint.itch.io/sorting-battle) - An open-source fast-paced competitive puzzle game about sorting numbers on a grid. Powered by reinforcement learning! You can also get its source code [from my GitHub repository](https://github.com/chocola-mint/Sorting-Battle).

### :computer: Technical abilities
- **Unity (C#)**: I've written everything from high-level gameplay code to low-level mesh generation. I've even done VR with the Oculus SDK. Most of my C# code is in Game Jam entries, and my ability to use OOP effectively has allowed me to reuse code across Game Jams.
- Godot (GDScript): I made [this](https://chocola-mint.itch.io/please-uninstall) with it in about 1 week, and [this](https://chocola-mint.itch.io/lifeline) in about 3 days.
- C: The language that formally introduced me to programming. I know how to wrangle raw pointers, implement the usual algorithms taught in university, and can do a little bit of embedded programming (Arduino).
- C++: The language that introduced me to object-oriented programming. I've also done some OpenGL graphics programming in it before. My biggest C++ project so far is a Qt GUI project, so that probably is saying something about my C++ abilities. I've also done some Unreal-related stuff in private, but nothing worth releasing at the moment.
- Python: The first scripting language I learned. I don't really have Python projects, but I've written Python scripts a lot as a more maintainable shell script, boosting my productivity.
- JavaScript: I know how to use anonymous functions and async, so I'd say I know a lot about the language itself.
- Cocos Creator (TypeScript): I used it to make the game [Operation: Stardust](https://chocola-mint.itch.io/operation-stardust).
- Svelte (TypeScript): I know some basic stuff, enough to build [my personal homepage](https://chocola-mint.github.io/) with it.
- Java: A language I learned after learning C#. (C# is really just Microsoft Java, eh?) I've written multithreaded Java for a Database Systems course.
- Verilog/SystemVerilog: I hope I won't ever have to write these again... But for the record I made [this](https://github.com/chocola-mint/Dance-Invaders) with it.
